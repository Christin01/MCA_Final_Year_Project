Abstract
Agriculture play an important role in maintaining human life, & technological advances have 
contributed significantly to improving agricultural productivity. The project is a sensor-based 
smart agricultural monitoring system using Web & IoT, integrating web-based surveillance 
and nanotechnology (IoT), aiming to optimize farming efficiency, optimize resource use and 
improve harvest revenue. These sensors send real-time data to cloud-based servers via IoT
enabled devices such as microcontrollers ESP32. The collected data is displayed on a web
based dashboard, allowing farmers to monitor and control a variety of agricultural parameters 
from afar. The most important features of the system include automatic irrigation control. In 
this irrigation control, the level of soil moisture levels determines the actual warnings of water 
needs and important conditions such as drought, excessive moisture, and temperature 
fluctuations. Additionally, the system provides data analysis and visualization that allows 
farmers to make well-discovered decisions to improve plant health and productivity. The 
proposed solution is intended to create a sustainable, inexpensive and user-friendly approach 
for modern precision breeding.
